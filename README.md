This repository contains several addons that I made for fun.
The current addons available here are:
  - **coolSpawnersAddon [NOT UP TO DATE, MIGHT NOT WORK]:** a big bunch of new spawner classes with their goofy minions, includes Arms race tiers but still works without the arms race addon (which is not even released as I write this lol). Includes the auto, factory and drive versions of the tier 3 spawners (if basic is tier 0).
  - **pentaFinalAddon [NOT UP TO DATE, MIGHT NOT WORK]:** I thought it was dumb that there was no pentagon final boss so... I made one! it is a mix of all pentagon-based bosses, plus some others weapons that fit well.
  - **realTanks [WIP]:** An addon that implements tons of realistic tanks of history, as well as infantry carriers, mobile artillery, missile launchers, ambulances with healing ability and others military vehicles.
